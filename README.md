> A curated list of awesome resources for *really* making America great.

## Disclaimer

- We're all for taking action, but do it in a *peaceful, lawful, non-violent way*.  All liability and risk is yours.
- We're not funded by any individual or person.  If that changes, we will say so.
- We're not responsible for any trouble you get into, either with the laws or with people who threaten you.
- This list is primarily aimed at citizens of the United States of America, but those outside the country are still welcome to contribute to this list if they'd like to.
- Unless otherwise noted, any link to an external resource *does* imply our endorsement of that resource.
- We are *not* accepting money or donations.  If you want to help, do the things that this list suggests you do!

## Introduction

Let's be frank; anyone who stands for inclusiveness, diversity, equality, and fairness is *not* gonna be happy with the next four years.  Half of the country is going to be on defense for the next four years.

focused on political efforts and policy changes

### What this list is

- The answer to the question "What can I do about it?"
- Focused on American issues.  For the purposes of this list, global issues that directly impact Americans are also applicable.  You are welcome (and encouraged!) to make a list similar to this one for your own country, and we'll happily link to it if it meets our quality standards.
- Focused on political action.  Things like feminism and veganism are great, but they're simply not within the scope of this list unless they're framed within the realm of effecting policy changes.

### What this list is not

- We are not trying to convert anyone or change their mind.  We doubt hardcore Trump-ites are all that interested in this list (but hey, sometimes you get lucky).
- Politically neutral.  **While we're not run by or funded by a political party**, we will be upfront in acknowledging that the Democratic Party is our best hope of putting the principles we stand for into practice.  If this changes, so be it.
- A circlejerk of empty rhetoric.  Quotes about staying idle being the ultimate evil are all fine and good, but this isn't the place for them.

## What's at stake?

What could possibly go wrong?  This section will help answer that.  **All of these articles are from reputable sources and are based entirely in fact and historical precedent.  You will not find speculation or hyperbole here.**

## Official Resources

This section refers to official government resources.  More for completeness than anything

## How does it work?

To help change within the system, you must understand it.  Thankfully, it's not as hard as you think.

## Politicians

People tend to fall into patterns.  Find out what patterns your representative follows.

## The Issues

debunking myths about planned parenthood
climate change (deserves its own list)

## Voting

We're not gonna lie; whether or not your vote matters really depends on where you live.  There's a reason we have a notion of swing states.

The presidential election every four years is fine, but it's *far* from the only way to officially get your voice heard.  The next midterms will be in 2018.  **Vote in them, for Christ's sake.**

## Acting Locally

## Places to Donate To

charities

### Places to NOT Donate To

As the title implies, we advise *against* donating to any of these organizations; this section is for organizations that *in theory* align with the interests of the American people, but in practice squander their money or do the opposite of what they claim to.  (I.e. we're not going to list pro-life charities, because if you're reading this you should know better)
